# Getting started

## Installation

Please check the official laravel installation guide for server requirements before you start. [Official Documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/installation)

Alternative installation is possible without local dependencies relying on [Docker](#docker). 

Clone the repository

    git clone https://github.com/mdnurulmomen/PetShop.git

Switch to the repo folder

    cd PetShop

Install all the dependencies using composer

    composer install

Copy the example env file and make the required configuration changes in the .env file

    cp .env.example .env

Generate a new application key

    php artisan key:generate

Run the database migrations 
(**Set the database connection & credentials mentioned in .env before migrating**)

    php artisan migrate

Generate a new JWT authentication secret key

    php artisan jwt:secret

Run the database seeder

    php artisan db:seed

## JWT Config

To work **asymmetric** token, we need both **public** & **private** keys. 
In order to generate those, we need a strong passphrase that should not be shared. In this test project I’ll use this (the following key is just for this demo purpose.

**_Note_:** Please change it for your system):

    sO9sH6qT8jA0wV5gE5eT3kY2

And I generated **public** and **private** keys with this passphrase key and already included at `storage/jwt`  directory. 

**_Note_:** Please, change the keys if you would work on enhancement. The command to generate an RSA private key of 4096 bits encrypted via AES256 into storage/jwt/private.pem is:

    openssl genrsa -passout pass:sO9sH6qT8jA0wV5gE5eT3kY2 -out storage/jwt/private.pem -aes256 4096


To generate the public key from our private key:

    openssl rsa -passin pass:sO9sH6qT8jA0wV5gE5eT3kY2 -pubout -in storage/jwt/private.pem -out storage/jwt/public.pem

Now we have public.pem and private.pem into our `storage/jwt` folder. We’ll add to the `.env` file our JWT configuration about the algorithm used and our keys :

    JWT_ALGO=RS256
    JWT_PUBLIC_KEY=jwt/public.pem
    JWT_PRIVATE_KEY=jwt/private.pem
    JWT_PASSPHRASE=sO9sH6qT8jA0wV5gE5eT3kY2

Please, make sure `config/jwt.php` file is updated to inform about the location of the private and public key:

    'public' => 'file://'.storage_path(env('JWT_PUBLIC_KEY')),
    
    'private' => 'file://'.storage_path(env('JWT_PRIVATE_KEY')),

Start the local development server and you're done

    php artisan serve

You can now access the server at http://localhost:8000

    
## Docker

To install with [Docker](https://www.docker.com), run following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/mdnurulmomen/PetShop.git
cd PetShop
cp .env.example.docker .env
docker run -v $(pwd):/app composer install
cd ./docker
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose exec php php artisan key:generate
docker-compose exec php php artisan jwt:secret
docker-compose exec php php artisan migrate
docker-compose exec php php artisan db:seed
docker-compose exec php php artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0
```

## API Specification

The [API](http://localhost:8000/api/v1) can be accessed at [API-Documentation](http://localhost:8000/api/documentation). This documentation is generated by [Swagger](https://github.com/DarkaOnLine/L5-Swagger).

# Authentication
 
This applications uses JSON Web Token (JWT) to handle authentication. The token is passed with each request using the `Authorization` header with `Token` scheme. The JWT authentication middleware handles the validation and authentication of the token. Please check the following sources to learn more about JWT.
